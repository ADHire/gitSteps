      <p>Swap back over to your terminal, and paste what you had copied. Don't worry about pasting twice, your terminal/command prompt will automatically run the first command that has been pasted, then it will require you to press <kbd>ENTER</kbd> to submit the second command.</p>

      <p>Once you press <kbd>ENTER</kbd> to submit that second line, you <b><u>may</u></b> or <b><u>may not</u></b> be prompted for your <b>GitHub</b> username/password. <u>Please remember that when prompted for your password, it may seem like you aren't typing because there will be no input shown.</u> This is a security check so others cannot see your password as it is being typed in.</p>

      <p>Once you submit your username and password, you should be seeing a bunch of output from your terminal. It will be a long list containing things such as: <samp>'Counting Objects'</samp>, <samp>'Delta Compression'</samp>, <samp>'Writing Objects'</samp>and some other cool things.</p>
